# Busted! Create an ML-Powered Speed Trap

In this project, I built a portable speed trap that can be used to monitor
traffic conditions in your neighborhood. By using an ML model to identify
vehicles, a doppler radar sensor to detect speed, and a
[cellular module](https://blues.io/) to relay the data to the cloud, it was
surprisingly easy to build out this IoT solution!
